# Image_Recognition_ML
This project builds an AI system in Python for image recognition using deep learning (CNNs). It processes and trains on image datasets to learn features and classify objects accurately. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, it supports applications like digit recognition, object detection, and real-time classification.
